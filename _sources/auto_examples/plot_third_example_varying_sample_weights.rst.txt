Third Example: Injecting varying ``sample_weight`` vectors to a linear regression model for GridSearchCV
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example illustrates a case in which a varying vector is injected to a linear regression model as ``sample_weight`` in order to evaluate them and obtain the sample_weight that generates the best results.
Let's imagine we have a sample_weight vector and different powers of the vector are needed to be evaluated. To perform such experiment, the following constrains appear:

- The shape of the graph is not a linear sequence as those that can be implemented using Pipeline.
- More than two variables (typically: ``X`` and ``y``) need to be accordingly split in order to perform the cross validation with GridSearchCV, in this case: ``X``, ``y`` and ``sample_weight``.
- The information provided to the  ``sample_weight`` parameter of the LinearRegression step varies on the different scenarios explored by GridSearchCV. In a GridSearchCV with Pipeline, ``sample_weight`` can't vary because it is treated as a ``fit_param`` instead of a variable.

Steps of the PipeGraph:

- **selector**: Featuring a :class:`ColumnSelector` custom step. This is not a sklearn original object but a custom class that allows to split an array into columns. In this case, ``X`` augmented data is column-wise divided as specified in a mapping dictionary. We previously created an augmented ``X`` in which all data but ``y`` is concatenated and it will be used by :class:`GridSearchCV` to make the cross validation splits. **selector** step de-concatenates such data.
- **custom_power**: Featuring a :class:`CustomPower` custom class. A simple transformation of the input data that is powered to a specified power as indicated in ``param_grid``.
- **scaler**: implements :class:`MinMaxScaler` class
- **polynomial_features**: Contains a :class:`PolynomialFeatures` object
- **linear_model**: Contains a :class:`LinearRegression` model

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
    from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    from pipegraph.pipeGraph import PipeGraphRegressor, CustomPower, ColumnSelector, Reshape
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt







We create an augmented ``X`` in which all data but ``y`` is concatenated. In this case, we concatenate ``X`` and ``sample_weight`` vector.



.. code-block:: python


    X = pd.DataFrame(dict(X=np.array([   1,    2,    3,    4,    5,    6,    7,    8,    9,   10,   11]),
              sample_weight=np.array([0.01, 0.95, 0.10, 0.95, 0.95, 0.10, 0.10, 0.95, 0.95, 0.95, 0.01])))
    y = np.array(                    [  10,    4,   20,   16,   25 , -60,   85,   64,   81,  100,  150])








Next we define the steps and connections of the PipeGraph and define  ``param_grid`` as expected by :class:`GridSearchCV` exploring a few possibilities of varying parameters.
Please, refer to the :ref:`first example <example1>` for a description of the connections syntax.



.. code-block:: python


    scaler = MinMaxScaler()
    polynomial_features = PolynomialFeatures()
    linear_model = LinearRegression()
    custom_power = CustomPower()
    selector = ColumnSelector(mapping={'X': slice(0, 1),
                                       'sample_weight': slice(1,2)})

    steps = [('selector', selector),
             ('custom_power', custom_power),
             ('scaler', scaler),
             ('polynomial_features', polynomial_features),
             ('linear_model', linear_model)]

    connections = { 'selector':     {'X':'X'},
                    'custom_power': {'X': ('selector', 'sample_weight')},
                    'scaler':       {'X': ('selector', 'X')},
                    'polynomial_features': {'X': ('scaler', 'predict')},
                    'linear_model': {'X': ('polynomial_features', 'predict'),
                                     'y': 'y',
                                     'sample_weight': ('custom_power', 'predict')}  }

    param_grid = {'polynomial_features__degree': range(1, 3),
                  'linear_model__fit_intercept': [True, False],
                  'custom_power__power': [1, 5, 10, 20, 30]}







Then, we use :class:`PipeGraphRegressor` as estimator for :class:`GridSearchCV` and perform the ``fit`` and ``predict`` operations.



.. code-block:: python


    pgraph = PipeGraphRegressor(steps=steps, connections=connections)
    grid_search_regressor = GridSearchCV(estimator=pgraph, param_grid=param_grid, refit=True)
    grid_search_regressor.fit(X, y)
    y_pred = grid_search_regressor.predict(X)

    plt.scatter(X.loc[:,'X'], y)
    plt.scatter(X.loc[:,'X'], y_pred)
    plt.show()

    power = grid_search_regressor.best_estimator_.get_params()['custom_power']
    print('Power that obtains the best results in the linear model: \n {}'.format(power))

This example displayed a non linear workflow successfully implemented by PipeGraph, while at the same time showing a way to circumvent current limitations of standard :class:`GridSearchCV`, in particular, the retriction on the number of input parameters.
:ref:`Next examples <example4>` show more elaborated examples in increasing complexity order.
